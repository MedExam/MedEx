      <p><b>What We intend to do?</b></p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Storing gum scores using Myo.</li>
          <li>Recording video and audio notes, streaming the examination procedure using Glass</li>
          <li>Prepare an EHR</li>

        </ul>


      <p><b>Why is this needed?</b></p>
      <ul>

        <li>Cost to implement EHRs -  $15,000 to $70,000 per provider. Small nursing homes cannot afford third-party installed EHRs.</li>
        <li>Low acceptance in dental industry</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Briefly..</b></p>
      <p>Technology like Glass has the potential to change many fields, including the dental
        industry. Instead of writing down notes about patient case histories, a dentist could
        easily record his or her notes while examining the patient. Also, the doctor can record
        his observations while examining the patient itself. This ensures that he doesn’t have
        to remember what to write down later and you also take pictures to examine them
        when he has more time. In some cases, it can be valuable to record an actual
        procedure as well. Normally this would involve another person with a video camera.
        Using Google Glass would make it much easier and it also has the advantage of being
        able to record from the point of view of the doctor. This also helps the doctors enter
        patient’s exam information in an EMR while completing the exam without having any
        contact with a screen (only through voice commands or Myo gestures).</p>
      <p>
        In addition, we indend to use Myo Armbands for entering gum observations during
        an examination. Check out the image below. The "cursor" starts in the first tooth
        and as the scores are provided it automatically moves the cursor left -> right and then
        top -> down so that way the dentist can just gesture off the scores and the app will
        record it for that tooth and move onto the next one.

      <p><b>What have we done so far?</b></p>
      <p>Here is a small video demonstrating our gum-score feature. Next up is Google Glass and it is coming soon..</p>
